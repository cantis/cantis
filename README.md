- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Evan
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, Flask, IOT Raspbery Pi and Pico
- I work as a Dev Lead and we use C# / Asp.net
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python Test Mocking
- ğŸ“« You can reach me here on github, I'm on frequently. 

I've been in the IT industry for a long time in various forms. My python work is relatively new, starting mid 2020. I try and share what I'm currently
working on as a personal coding journal and a bit of (not done well) accountability. 

Have a great day!
