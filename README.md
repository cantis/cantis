- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Evan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, Flask, FastAPI, IOT Raspbery Pi and Pico, software development theory and more. 
- I work as a Dev Lead and we use C# / Asp.net
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (Flask, FastAPI, Jupyter Labs)
- And Docker / Codespaces
- ðŸ“« You can reach me here on github, I'm on frequently.
- Next project is learning VUE, so I can connect to FastAPI back ends... 

I've been in the IT industry for a long time in various forms. My python work is relatively new, starting mid 2020 and continues now in 2023. I try and share what I'm currently
working on as a personal coding journal and this is my attempt to follow the idea of [Working with the Garage Door Up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up?stackedNotes=z2DABWsGLkXcCuUet2scfD1duL1ZHBztwGKp&ref=joe-cecil.com) It lets my 'messy garage workbench' been seen, have the neighbours stop over and comment, this is my work in progress. You're welcome to peruse what you find here, it isn't in any particular order, includes many false starts, abandonded and dead end projects and it brings me joy. Tread carefully, none of this is truly 'finished project as yet. 

Have a great day!
